Project 2 READ_ME file
Introduction 

The application I’ve developed meets all the client’s requirements. This application was designed using python 3 and Jupiter Notebook. 

The application is made up of two modules: the backend, which acts as a bridge between the front end and the database which connects and retrieves data from the user database. 

The database system I’m using has the following benefits: 

It can handle large volumes of data at high speed 

It enables easy updates to schema and fields 

Developer friendly 

Takes full advantage of the cloud  

This app was developed to provide data to the user that meets specific requirements. The user will be able to see all the data in the database, but also narrow down by different catagories. 

About the project: 

Below is a screenshot showing the window to filter data, the radio button interface, and the table of data displayed when a user narrows down the desired output.

Next are the geo-charts and graphs:

The table only shows the animals from the selected category, saving the user time from having to scroll through undesired datapoints. 

The following is a web map which shows the location of the company and some details of the selected animal. A tool like this gives the users a better idea of what animals would be closer for potential adoption.  


Selected data:

Steps I followed: 

In the first milestones, I uploaded the csv file into mongodb for further use. 

I then created the .txt and Python file in Jupyter to perform the functions necessary. 

I added the visuals through code and tested my code to make sure it was funcitonal  

About Dash Library 

The dash library is an easy tool and there are a lot of tutorials on the internet to help with any problems I could have. This makes learning easy and utilizing the libraries easier. Dash provides many tools for data representation, visualization, and provides components for capturing input from user. 

The components can be easily formatted using CSS, which makes the display more visually appealing 

The main challenge I faced with this project was the issue of error handling. Capturing exceptions isn’t as easy as it is with other languages just because between using a few different tools, it can be difficult to catch mistakes and find the source.  

 Additional reflection:
 
How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. 

Using the coding best practices allows me to create code the is readable, maintainable, and adaptable. These practices include: correct indentation, consistent naming habbits, and writing and testing code in small chunks.

What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?

Working this way allows both myself and other potential people to make changes to the code easily because a lot of potential errors and bugs in the code can be avoided.

How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?

COmputer science I all about analyzing the requirements, breaking down the requirements into different categories, ie. functional and non-functional, and designing code based around how best those functionalities would be implemented in chunks of code. 

What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?

Computer science is by definition the study of principles and uses of computers. Since the modern world basically revolves around technology, understanding, maintaining, and creating new technology is imperative to the future of the world. 

My work here would make it easier for the company to perform queries that would save an enourmous amout of time that would otherwise be spent scrolling through the long list of data.
